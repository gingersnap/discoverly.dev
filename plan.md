# Discoverly Marketing Page Plan

## Executive Summary

Discoverly will position itself as the **anti-enterprise** product discovery tool—built for individual product managers who want to practice continuous discovery without the complexity, committees, or corporate overhead. Our marketing page will emphasize visual simplicity, immediate value, and human-centered design.

## Competitive Positioning

### What We ARE
- The "Notion of product discovery"—accessible, visual, and individual-first
- A tool you can start using in your next customer call
- Built specifically for Teresa Torres' Opportunity Solution Trees
- Free forever for core features, not a limited trial
