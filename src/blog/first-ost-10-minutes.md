# Your First Opportunity Solution Tree in 10 Minutes

If you're tired of customer insights getting lost in spreadsheets and feeling overwhelmed by enterprise discovery tools, you're in the right place. Today, I'll show you how to create your first Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) in just 10 minutes using Discoverly.

## What You'll Learn

- What an Opportunity Solution Tree actually is (hint: it's simpler than it sounds)
- How to capture and organize customer insights visually
- Why this approach beats traditional note-taking every time
- A step-by-step walkthrough of your first tree

## What Is an Opportunity Solution Tree?

Created by Teresa Torres, an Opportunity Solution Tree is a visual map that connects:
- **Outcomes**: What you're trying to achieve
- **Opportunities**: Customer needs and pain points
- **Solutions**: Ideas to address those opportunities
- **Experiments**: Ways to test your solutions

Think of it as a mind map specifically designed for product discovery. Instead of linear notes, you see how everything connects.

## Step 1: Start with Your Outcome (2 minutes)

Every good discovery starts with clarity on what you're trying to achieve. In Discoverly:

1. Create a new tree
2. Add your outcome at the top: "Increase user engagement by 20%"
3. Make it specific and measurable

**Pro tip**: If you can't measure it, it's not an outcomeâ€”it's a wish.

## Step 2: Add Your First Opportunity (3 minutes)

Now, think about a recent customer conversation. What problem did they mention?

1. Create an opportunity card
2. Write the problem in the customer's words: "I forget to check the app"
3. Drag it under your outcome

Don't overthink this. You can always refine later.

## Step 3: Branch Out with Related Opportunities (3 minutes)

One opportunity usually reveals others:

- "I forget to check the app" might connect to:
  - "No reason to open it daily"
  - "Notifications are annoying"
  - "Takes too long to find what I need"

Add 2-3 related opportunities. Watch how patterns emerge visually that you'd miss in a list.

## Step 4: Add Solution Ideas (2 minutes)

For each opportunity, brainstorm solutions:

- For "I forget to check the app":
  - Daily insight notifications
  - Email digest option
  - Widget for home screen

Don't judge ideas yet. Capture everything.

## Your Tree Is Born! ðŸŒ³

Congratulations! You've just created your first Opportunity Solution Tree. In 10 minutes, you've:
- Clarified your outcome
- Mapped customer opportunities
- Connected solutions to real problems
- Created a visual discovery artifact

## What's Next?

1. **Keep adding**: After each customer conversation, add new insights
2. **Look for patterns**: Which opportunities come up repeatedly?
3. **Share instantly**: Send a link to your teamâ€”no logins required
4. **Zoom in**: Use focus mode to work on specific branches

## The Real Magic

The power isn't in the toolâ€”it's in the visual thinking. When you see opportunities connected to outcomes and solutions, you make better product decisions. 

No more guessing what customers said three weeks ago. No more losing insights in meeting notes. Just clear, visual discovery that grows with your understanding.

## Ready to Start?

Your first tree is waiting. No credit card, no team approval, no 30-minute onboarding. Just you and your insights.
