1. Write like you're explaining to a smart friend
Keep it conversational and casual. Use short sentences and simple words. No corporate speak or formality.
2. Share knowledge, don't sell it
Be factual and informative without hype or sales pitches. Focus on learning together rather than preaching.
3. Stay curious and exploratory
Ask questions, consider possibilities, and think forward. Show genuine interest in discovering new angles.
4. Be direct and clear
Get to the point quickly. If something is complex, break it down simply. Clarity beats cleverness.
5. Keep it light but not lightweight
Be lighthearted without forcing humor. Stay grounded without being too serious. Find the middle ground between playful and professional.
